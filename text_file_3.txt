When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are publishing an open source project or collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   This way it doesnâ€™t overwrite anything you were doing offline.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks: copies a repository on github
	Clones: local copies, that you can then create your own repository from
	Branches: off of the local master branch


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    	That way you can make relevant changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Probably using some folder structure similar to the branching system. Git is obviously easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Usually during collaboration when multiple people are working on the file. That way people have a 
    chance to comment and inspect changes before they are merged into the master.
