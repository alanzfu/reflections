# reflections

This was part of the Udacity Learn Git/Github series. The series was divided into 3 lessons where they taught you the basics
of git and github.

For each lesson, it was suggested that we go through the reflections and make sure that we understood sections and reflected
upon specific concepts. There is one text file per lesson in the series.
